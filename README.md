# Greater-Manchester-Area-Airbnb-Analysis
## Getting Started
This is an analysis of Airbnb listings in the Greater Manchester Area. The dataset used has 3584 listings with information like price, 
host information, amenities, ratings and many other features present in the dataset. 
## Installations
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit Learn
## Project Motivation
The following questions served as a guide in the analysis of listings in the Greater Manchester Area. 
- What areas or towns have the most airbnb listings?
- What are the best type of listings based on ratings data?
- What are the price characteristics of Airbnb listings in the Greater Manchester Area?
- What is the spread of listings per host?
- What type of rooms are available in the Greater Manchester Area?
- Can a machine learning model be used to predict prices of Airbnb listings in the area?
## File Description
* Data: contains the datasets used in the analysis. 
* airbnb_updated: A copy of the notebook used for the analysis. 
## Results
The machine learning model used to predict price listings achieved an R-Squared value of 50% which means the features 
used in the model can explain 50% of the variability in price of the listings. 
Here's my medium article explaining findings from an exploratory and explanatory analysis of the dataset as well as 
results from the machine learning model:
